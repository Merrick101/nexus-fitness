**Semantic Markup:**
- HTML5 tags like header, nav, main, and footer provide structural meaning, aiding screen readers.
**ARIA Labels**
- ARIA labels were applied to buttons and links to improve screen reader compatibility.

## AI Tools Usage

### Midjourney
Midjourney was instrumental in creating high-quality visuals for Nexus Fitness, specifically images that represent the gym's facilities and classes in action. These visuals were designed to evoke a sense of motivation and inclusivity, aligning with the brand's goal to create an inviting and inspiring fitness environment.

**Images Created**
- Yoga Class Visuals: Generated calming and serene images featuring individuals practicing yoga in well-lit studio settings, reinforcing the class's focus on mindfulness and flexibility.
- Weightlifting Class Visuals: Depicted strength and determination by showcasing individuals performing lifts in professional gym environments.
- Boxing Class Visuals: Highlighted energy and intensity through dynamic action shots of boxing training sessions.

**Challenges and Iterations**
- The biggest challenge was crafting prompts that accurately reflected the intended mood and class environment without introducing elements that might confuse users (e.g., overly abstract or unrealistic visuals). After several iterations:

    - Adjusted prompts to include terms like "minimalistic," "modern gym," and "bright lighting" to ensure the images matched the site's clean and professional aesthetic.
    - Tested images for user feedback to confirm they complemented the site's content rather than overwhelming it.

**Impact on the Project**
These visuals enhanced user engagement by providing a professional and cohesive aesthetic that resonates with the target audience. The high-quality images helped establish Nexus Fitness as a credible and appealing fitness brand.
